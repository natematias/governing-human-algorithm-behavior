Algorithms that monitor and influence human behavior are everywhere—directing the behavior of law enforcement, managing the world's financial systems, shaping our cultures, and flipping a coin on the success or failure of movements for change. Since human-algorithm feedback is already a basic pattern in society, we urgently need ways to assess the impact of attempts to steer that feedback toward justice.

In 2023, the challenge became even clearer when Attorney General Letitia James and 31 other state Attorneys General filed a federal lawsuit against Meta for allegedly "[harming young people's mental health and contributing to the youth mental health crisis](https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorney-general-james-and-multistate-coalition-sue-meta-harming-youth)." One of the lawsuit's claims is that Meta, through Facebook and Instagram, encouraged compulsive use of the platform through its algorthms and design features—contributing to a widespread mental health crisis.

In this course for (15) upper-level undergraduates and (5) PhD students, you will learn about the design of adaptive algorithms and the feedback patterns they create with human behavior. You will learn about the challenge they represent for social policy, about ways to research their behavior, and about emerging policy ideas for governing these complex patterns. You will get first-hand experience at diagnosing and attempting to change a feedback system. Along the way, you will hear from pioneers in policy, advocacy, and scholarship.

This course is an excellent stepping stone for anyone interested in a career in policy, advocacy, academia, or industry research.

## What You Learn
In this seminar class, you will engage with the science and policy challenges of regulating human-algorithm behavior. Along the way, you will work with scientific issues of methods, theory, and ethics, policy questions about how to govern these situations, and how to bridge between science and policy in a democracy. For a final project, student teams (3-4) will produce a novel project that makes a contribution at the intersection of science and policy.

By the end of the semester, students will be able to:
- Identify, analyze, and evaluate claims about how human and algorithm behavior interact
- Summarize and criticize major approaches to governing human and algorithm behavior
- Describe and evaluate major governance approaches
- Design and analyze research methodologies for creating policy-relevant evidence for transparency, accountability, and change
- Understand the uses of social science and computer science research in the policy process
- Design an intervention into scholarly and policy conversations on human-algorithm behavior

PhD students are encouraged to connect the course to an existing research question that they wish to connect with policy, or to develop a project that could become part of their wider research.

## Activities

*Weekly Activities*:  Throughout the semester, students will read a selection of articles and discuss that reading in class and on Canvas. Once teams have been formed, students will also submit regular progress reports on their final project.

*Algorithm Incident Report*: The midterm is an analysis of an algorithm-involved event in the news, based on publicly-available information.

*Project Proposal*: Your project proposal will include a description of the project, a bibliography, a list of the roles that team members will play, and a timeline.

*Final Project*: An intervention into academic and/or policy conversations on human-algorithm research. In 2024, the class will support projects in three areas:
* An in-depth case study and/or forensic analysis of some failure of an adaptive algorithm ([see the AI Incident Database for ideas](https://incidentdatabase.ai/about/))
* A proposal for a "black box" or data schema of what to record to inform future analysis of incidents
* A digital simulation or card game that can be used to engage lived experience experts in critical thinking about human-algorithm behavior.

*Grading*: Participation in class & online: 30%. Midterm: 30%. Final project: 40%.

Questions to think about from Defeating Windigo:
* Think about an event related to algorithms and AI systems that matters to you. It might be an incident related to mental health, or discrimination, or something else
* Imagine the forces akin to "hunger" (the drive for more) and "gratitude" (a drive for less of something) that direct individuals and institutions toward **more** and which ones direct them toward **less** 
* Reflect on how those forces might have contributed to that event.

#### Thurs 02-01 Case Study: Teenage Mental Health
To build our intuitions about governing algorithms and what to do about it, we're going to consider a series of classes about discrimination online. This class introduces the first case study, related to allegations that Facebook and Instagram contributed to a teen mental health crisis.

Readings: TBD

<!--#### Thurs 02-24 Topic area: Algorithms, Self-Harm, and Eating Disorders
In this topic area session, we will discuss the role of algorithms in eating disorders and self-harm.

#### Tues 02-06 Case Study: Algorithms and Discrimination
To build our intuitions about governing algorithms and what to do about it, we're going to consider a series of classes about discrimination online. This class introduces the problem of discrimination in online labor markets.

* McGhee, H. (2021). "Racism Drained the Pool" from The sum of us: What racism costs everyone and how we can prosper together. One World.
 * Read pages 17 - 28
* Cox, M. (2017) [The Face of Airbnb, New York City](http://insideairbnb.com/reports/the-face-of-airbnb-nyc.pdf). ([read about the project](https://medium.com/bloomberg/meet-murray-cox-the-man-trying-to-take-down-airbnb-ce9e81faf9f6))
* (gradstudents) Edelman, B. G., & Luca, M. (2014). [Digital discrimination: The case of Airbnb. com.](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2377353) Harvard Business School NOM Unit Working Paper, (14-054).

Questions to think about from The Sum of Us: 
* What is a public good? (you might want to bring in knowledge from other courses)
* What was the role of institutions (such as city councils) in upholding discrimination at pools before de-segregation? What was their role afterward?
* What was the role of White swimmers in upholding discrimination at pools before de-segregation? What was their role afterward?
* The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited discrimination in public accommodations and federally funded programs, requiring towns to make public services equally available to everyone regardless of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. Why might we believe that changing institutional policies could reduce discrimination?
* Did changes to government policies reduce discrimination in pools?
* If we wanted to describe discrimination in public pools as a feedback loop, how would we do that?

Questions to think about from The Face of Airbnb:
* Why might Black people in predominantly-Black New York City neighborhoods make less on Airbnb?
* What other harms might Airbnb represent for Black residents beyond differences in rental rates?
* How do inequality and discrimination occur on Airbnb?
* Why did Murray Cox write this report? Who was his audience? What did he hope to achieve?

#### Thurs 02-08 Case Study on Discrimination: Laws, Individuals, Organizations, and Code
Discrimination has a history and is reinforced through feedback from multiple sources beyond software: laws, individuals, organizations, and code. In this class, we will discuss how they interact.

Questions to consider from The Color of Law:
* How was discrimination built into:
    * Government housing allocation
    * Access to education
    * The geography of the Bay area
    * Government services
    * Policing
    * Jobs & employment
    * Access to loans
    * Public advertising

Questions to consider from Algorithms of Oppression:
* What is "racialization" ?
* How might the patterns described in The Color of Law influence the patterns observed in Algorithms of Oppression?
    * Who gets to create algorithms
    * Who gets to teach the people who create algorithms
    * What information the algorithms learn from
    * What questions people type into search boxes
    * What ads appear next to search terms

Overall questions: 
* how might we describe these patterns as feedback loops?
* what makes algorithms similar to other sources of discrimination, and what makes them different?

#### Thurs 02-15 Data, Evidence, and Strategic Litigation
In this class, we will hear from someone working on litigation alleging that Meta should be held responsible for a mental health impact on teenagers.

* Reading: TBD

<!--#### Thurs 02-10 Case Study: Bias, Fairness, and Human-Algorithm Feedback
Common discussions of algorithm governance focus on decision-making, which is a simpler problem than human-algorithm feedback. In this class, we will discuss this difference between the two.

#### Tues 02-20 What is an AI Incident?
In order for algorithms to be governed, we need to be able to describe what happens when one goes wrong. So what is an incident anyway, and how would we establish that harm had occurred?

#### Thurs 02-22 Discussing final project ideas
In this class, we will discuss possible final project ideas for the course.

In preparation for the class, meet with a possible project team to develop ideas for collective feedback and discussion.


As a reminder, final project ideas include one of three options:
* An in-depth case study and/or forensic analysis of some failure of an adaptive algorithm ([see the AI Incident Database for ideas](https://incidentdatabase.ai/about/))
* A proposal for a "black box" or data schema of what to record to inform future analysis of incidents
* A digital simulation or card game that can be used to engage lived experience experts in critical thinking about human-algorithm behavior.

#### Thurs 03-29 Feedback Pattern: Reinforcement
In a series of sessions, we will discuss common patterns of human-algorithm feedback. The first is reinforcement, which happens with individuals in the case of personalization and with groups in the case of herding behavior.

---


#### Thurs 03-05 Feedback Pattern: Herding
Algorithms can amplify herding behavior by encouraging people to do something that's already popular. Ranking software has been credited with inspiring large-scale acts of charity, spreading prejudice and encouraging harassment mobs. When enough people engage in collective discrimination, adaptive systems can entrench injustice further. This class will investigate herding as a phenomenon of human + algorithm behavior.

* Salganik, M. J., Dodds, P. S., & Watts, D. J. (2006). [Experimental study of inequality and unpredictability in an artificial cultural market](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1121066). Science, 311(5762), 854–856.

* (graduate students) Brayne, S. (2020). "Directed Surveillance: Predictive Policing and Quantified Risk," from Predict and surveil: Data, discretion, and the future of policing. Oxford University Press, USA.

Questions to discuss:
* How does herding happen even without algorithms? What ideas from your other classes or research might help explain herding? (COMM 2450 students - remember threshold models?) 
* How might herding create social change you want to see in the world, as well as harms to avoid?
* How might we interrupt herding, and how might you test it?
* Who should have the right to interrupt herding?

<!--
#### Tues 03-08 Case Study: Algorithms as Solutions to Discrimination
Can algorithms reduce dicrimination since they're easier to change than biased humans? So far, this has only been deliberately tried with decision-making systems, so the answer is unknown. So in this class, we look at algorithm solutions to decision-making discrimination.

---

#### Thurs 03-07 Feedback Pattern: Thresholds
Patterns of human and algorithm behavior can dramatically change when their behavior reaches a certain threshold. For example, a popular conversation within a marginalized group might attract harassment if an algorithm amplifies it to a wider population where hatred prevails.

* (gradstudents) Biggins, David. [Goodbye, Thunderclap: How social media storms closed the popular crowdspeaking platform](https://luminouspr.com/goodbye-thunderclap-how-social-media-storms-closed-the-popular-crowdspeaking-platform/). Luminous PR.

Questions for discussion:
* How might adaptive algorithms change how threshold models work, by influencing certain thresholds or influencing who is visible to whom?
* If people have thresholds, how might algorithms also have thresholds? How can we influence algorithm thresholds?
* How might thresholds be useful tools for governing human-algorithm behavior?

---

#### Tues 03-12 Methods Area: Simulations

People claim that algorithms amplify and spread hatred, misogyny and extremism. How could we tell, and what can we do about it? In this class, we will use the example of the spread of misogyny on Reddit as the basis of imagining simulations.

* Reading on simulations TBD

Questions for discussion:
* So far we have been considering theories and patterns. Now let's start applying the concepts we're considering in class to specific cases:
   * How can the concepts we've considered in class help us understand misogyny and extremism online?
   * How can the concepts from class help us envision interventions and policies to create change?

Questions for discussion:
* What is a tech policy, really?
* What is a platform policy, really?
* What kind of policy outcomes can be achieved (or not) with code?

---

#### Tues 03-19 Finalizing Student Projects
In your final-project teams, students will present a 3 minute presentation to summarize and analyze an issue in human-algorithm feedback that you would like to work on for your final. Fellow students will submit feedback and suggestions.

---

#### Thurs 03-21 How Can Evidence Inform Governance?
What is evidence-based governance and how might research contribute (or not) to policy? In this session, we'll discuss a model where researchers are advisors, versus a model where researchers are producing evidence that is used in courts and other contestational settings.

Questions for discussion in Canvas and in class:
* For your team's final project area:
   * What kind of evidence might be needed for policymaking
   * Is that kind of evidence possible yet?
   * Does the evidence already exist?
   * How does evidence already influence policy, if at all?
   * What forces are preventing evidence from being available?

#### Tues 03-26 Feedback Pattern: Chilling Effects on Rights
People are often influenced by algorithms by design, but algorithms can also have side effects. Algorithms can also cause a chilling effect when people are influenced against taking legally-protected actions such as avoiding certain streets or self-censoring their political views.

#### Thurs 04-09 Policy Topic: How Does Evidence Actually Inform Policy?
In previous classes, we discussed theories for how evidence could inform policy. How does it really happen?

* **Each Team** share on Canvas an example of a piece of research, journalism, or activism that genuinely impacted policy (ideally related to your project), and comment on how it did so. A especially high quality submission will be able to cite an example where someone made a claim about the relationship between the corporate/government policy change and the project. Comment on other team's examples, come prepared to discuss your team's example, and be prepared to ask questions and discuss other team's examples.

#### Tues 04-19 Policy Topic: Can Tech Ethics Prevent Harms?
Advocates of tech ethics argue that if we teach ethics to engineers, society will be more protected from the harms associated with algorithms. How much can that help?

* Silbey, S. S. (2009). [Taming Prometheus: Talk about safety and culture](https://anthropology.mit.edu/sites/default/files/documents/silbey_safety_culture.pdf). Annual Review of Sociology, 35, 341–369.

Questions for discussion on Canvas and in class:
* For the algorithm harms you and your team are thinking about:
   * What does it mean for things to be described as an "accident" and how does that imply certain kinds of solutions?
   * How do people place responsibility on individual engineers?
   * When do you think institutions rather than individuals should be responsible?
* What questions do you have about terms? Silbey is trying to summarize ~150 years of debates and regulation, so there's a lot going on!
   * What is an example of a "moral entrepreneur?"
   * What is "safety culture" and how do people identify culture as responsible for disasters and accidents?

#### Thurs 04-16 Policy Topic: Protecting Algorithms from Bad People with Content Moderation
If algorithms are just math formulas that offer a reflection of a broken world, one way to govern algorithms is to protect them from bad people. What does that look like?

* Clegg, N. (2021, March 31). [You and the Algorithm: It Takes Two to Tango](https://nickclegg.medium.com/you-and-the-algorithm-it-takes-two-to-tango-7722b19aa1c2). Medium.

#### Tues 04-18 Policy Topic: Creating Change With Courts
What influence can courts have on the behavior of companies, populations, and algorithms? 

* Charles, S. (2020, January 27). [CPD decommissions ‘Strategic Subject List.’](https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2020/1/27/21084030/chicago-police-strategic-subject-list-party-to-violence-inspector-general-joe-ferguson) Chicago Sun-Times.

#### Thurs 04-25 Policy Topic:Algorithmic Literacy
In order for democratic societies to govern a problem, people need to know about it and care enough to do something. How does the public understand and care about human-algorithm feedback?

* Druga, S., Christoph, F., & Ko, A. J. (2022). [Family as a Third Space for AI Literacies: How do children and parents learn about AI together?](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/papers/Druga2022FamilyAILiteracy.pdf).

<!--* (possible invited guests: Baobao Zhang, Natalize Bazarova)-->
Discussion questions:
* If the design of algorithms is controlled by engineers and most people aren't engineers, how would algorithm literacy actually make a difference in people's lives if at all?
* What kinds of knowledge about algorithms does a democratic public need?
* Given feedback loops between humans and algorithms, what social science knowledge should be included in algorithmic literacy projects?

<!--#### Thurs 04-28 Research Methods: Citizen Science and Field Experiments
How can we learn the safety of algorithms or the effectiveness of policies in real-world situations—while still limiting the risks? Field experiments, when conducted with public consent and careful oversight, enable researchers to audit systems and test policies in controlled circumstances with as few people as possible.

## Course Practices and Policies

### Weekly Workload

Before each class, I will assign **two readings** I expect you to read before class. As part of class participation, you will submit a reaction comment on one of the readings to the relevant discussion on Canvas and respond to at least one other student's comment by 9pm Eastern the night before class. Please come to class with:
* The ability to summarize:
  * the goal/question of the paper
  * the field or ecosystem that the author is in
  * what constitutes an advancement in that field
  * how the paper advances the conversation
  * a question or observation that links the paper to the theme of the day or the theme of the course 

Each week, students are expected to post at least one news article to Canvas add at least one comment in response to one other student's posted link.

Graduate students will have additional readings. Graduate students will also rotate responsibility for summarizing presenting to the class on the readings assigned to everyone. Summarizing the reading will involve:
* Creating 2-3 slides for the reading
  * Slide one: introducing the core question of the paper, and the authors
  * Slide two: summarize the methods and findings of the paper
  * Slide three: one to two discussion questions that link the paper to the theme of the class
* Alt: if the author of the paper is a guest speaker, the graduate student will interview the guest

Since this is a discussion course, attendance is expected.

### Participation in Discussions
Please post discussions about readings to Canvas. 

Whenever the course has assigned reading for a session, you are expected to post at least one top-level comment and one reply to someone else's comment. Participation will be 20% of your course grade.

### Team Progress Reports
During the project period of the class, teams will submit on Canvas a weekly progress report no more than one page long, as group homework. This progress report will be graded 0/1 based on whether it was submitted. Reports should include the following details (a sample template is available here):

* What your team made progress on
* What your team is doing next
* Who contributed what
* Where your team is stuck
* Any updates to your timeline

### Formats
Written assignments should be uploaded to Canvas in one of the following formats
* PDF
* Text file
* Word-compatible document

Slide decks should be submitted in one of the following formats:
* PowerPoint
* KeyNote
* Google Slides
* A Markdown slide presentation system (such as Marp)
* PDF

In cases where students choose to submit code or analysis as part of a project, I can accept assignments in the following languages:
* R (including R Markdown or Sweave)
* Python
* Ruby
* PHP
* C / C++

### Group Work and Academic Integrity
I expect students to follow the [Cornell University Code of Academic Integrity](https://www.library.cornell.edu/research/citation/code). You should submit your work as your own, cite sources and outside assistance, and credit people for their contributions.

This class includes group work and individual assignments. On group projects, you are encouraged to work together on the activities for the class, but you are only only able to put your name on projects to which you made an intellectual contribution. If you have any doubts about what is appropriate, ask me.

### Grading
I use the following grading scale, derived from Matt Salganik's grading practices.

All grades are final. There will not be any make-up or extra credit assignments offered.

Per university procedures, I will only give a grade of A+ in exceptional circumstances.

Letter Grade	Numeric Grade
* A	93 - 100
* A-	90 - 92.99
* B+	87 - 89.99
* B	83 - 86.99
* B-	80 - 82.99
* C+	77 - 79.99
* C	73 - 76.99
* C-	70 - 72.99
* D	60 - 66.99
* F	0 - 59.99

### Grace Period
Late Submissions: All assignments have an automatic one-day grace period. On time and early papers are always encouraged and will be graded the same week. Students can turn in the assignment up to a day late, no questions asked, with the expectation that it could take substantially longer to receive a grade and feedback. After that, an automatic one grade (A to B, B to C, etc) is dropped on the assignment.

If you turned in an assignment on time and haven't received a grade within the expected period, please contact the instructor in case of a technical glitch.

<!--### COVID Policies
Students are expected to follow [Cornell COVID policies for students](https://covid.cornell.edu/students/), including vaccination and masking. 
-->
### Accommodations
I am committed to working with students with recognized SDSes to ensure you have the best possible class experience. Please [follow these steps to get started](https://sds.cornell.edu/get-started).

### Health Accommodation for Professor Matias
As part of a [medical condition of my own](https://natematias.com/portfolio/2021-06-06-ithaca-allergies/), I may on rare occasion need to teach remotely. Since I may not be alerted to this need until the morning before class, I will ask the designated presenting graduate student to also set up a video chat feed for me to join. 

### Counseling Resources
It is common for students to experience stressful events at some point during graduate school. Students sometimes experience depression, anxiety, family stress, the loss of loved ones, financial strain, and other stressors. It is perfectly normal for students to seek the service of mental health professionals to provide them with support and skills to cope with these experiences. Below I have provided the contact information for some of the mental health services available to Cornell University students so that you will know where you can go if you or a friend would like to take advantage of these resources.

Cornell Health: 110 Ho Plaza, Ithaca NY. Phone: 607-255-5155.

If you require a short term accommodation, please let me know as soon as possible.

### Acknowledgments

I am grateful to my co-author Lucas Wright for his contributions to a review article that this course is based on, and to the Human-Algorithm-Behavior Research Collective for input. Several sections of these policies have been inspired by syllabi from Matthew Salganik, Adrienne Keene, and Neil Lewis Jr.
